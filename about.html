<h1>About Jaiti Foundation</h1>

<p class="section-text">
Jaiti Foundation is a grassroots initiative dedicated to ensuring that
no child is denied education because of poverty.

<!-- ================= OUR STORY ================= -->
<section class="section">
<div class="container about-content">

<h2>Our Story</h2>

<p>
Jaiti Foundation was started with a simple belief —
education should not be a privilege reserved for the few.
In underserved communities of Jaipur, many children leave school
not because they lack ability, but because financial hardship
forces families to prioritise survival over learning.
</p>

<p>
We began by supporting a few children.
Today, we are currently educating 60+ students and
have impacted 150+ children since 2024 —
providing completely free academic support,
school supplies, and mentorship.

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p class="section-text">
To provide free, consistent academic support and school funding
so that every child we work with can stay in school,
