                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Jaiti was founded in 2023 in Jaipur, India, with a simple yet powerful belief: every child, regardless of their economic background, deserves access to quality education.</p>
                <p>What started as a small initiative to help a few children in our community has grown into a movement that has touched the lives of over 50 children and their families. We witnessed firsthand how financial constraints forced bright, eager children to abandon their dreams of education. This reality drove us to action.</p>
                <p>Today, Jaiti stands as a beacon of hope for underprivileged children in Jaipur. We don't just teach – we invest in futures. By covering school fees, providing learning materials, and offering dedicated tutoring, we ensure that poverty is never a barrier to knowledge.</p>
